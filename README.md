# fall-detection-3Dpose
Project for fall detection using human pose estimation from video sequences

Falls are a leading source of injury among the
elderly, and being able to notice and respond to them quickly is
critical to their safety and well-being. In this extensive research
work, we offer a novel fall detection system that estimates
human position from video sequences. Our suggested system
combines two advanced feature extraction techniques: Metrabs
posture estimation and shadow suppression.The Metrabs posture
estimation technique is used to precisely record and evaluate the
human body’s posture and movements in video sequences. This
technology provides useful information on the person’s position,
orientation, and motion dynamics, which are critical for detecting
probable falls. Furthermore, the shadow suppression approach
is used to improve video frame quality by lowering the impact
of shadows, reflections, and other noise, which improves fall
detection accuracy.To assess the effectiveness and reliability of
our proposed fall detection system, we carried out comprehensive
experiments with a broad collection of movies depicting both
falls and non-fall scenarios. To assure our system’s robustness,
we painstakingly handpicked the dataset to cover a variety
of real-world circumstances and climatic variables.Our testing
results show that the suggested system can detect falls with an
amazing accuracy rate of 95%. This high detection accuracy
demonstrates the efficacy and dependability of our approach for
detecting fall events by predicting human position from video
frames. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the potential
for advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning
algorithms to improve geriatric safety and lower the incidence of
fall-related injuries.Our paper describes a unique and efficient
fall detection system that uses human location estimate from
video sequences. Our system can effectively identify falls in a
variety of demanding settings thanks to a combination of Metrabs
posture estimation and shadow suppression approaches. We feel
that our research makes a significant contribution to the field
of aged care and assistive technologies by giving a dependable
solution to a critical issue affecting the lives of millions of elderly
people throughout the world.
